Program in charge of generating two .txt files with an activity. One activity would be a maze and the other a word search, both in a file each. The maze will be generated in all the cases with the same size to avoid problems with the space of the file, but it would be required that the user introduce the name file of the maze. For word search, the program only wants to know the words the user wants in it, and the name of the file.
